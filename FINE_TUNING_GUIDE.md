## üõ†Ô∏è Data Preparation Process

### Step 1: Create Training Data Structure

Create a file called `training_data.jsonl` with this format:

```jsonl
{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are BahoAI, a health assistant for Rwanda. You speak fluent Kinyarwanda and have deep knowledge of Rwanda's health sector."}, {"role": "user", "content": "USER_QUESTION_IN_KINYARWANDA_OR_ENGLISH"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "DETAILED_HELPFUL_RESPONSE"}]}
```

### Step 2: Data Quality Guidelines

Each example should:
- ‚úÖ Be factually accurate
- ‚úÖ Use natural, conversational Kinyarwanda
- ‚úÖ Include specific Rwanda locations, hospitals, programs
- ‚úÖ Be culturally sensitive
- ‚úÖ Provide actionable advice
- ‚úÖ Include emergency contact info when relevant
- ‚úÖ Reference Rwandan health policies when applicable

### Step 3: Example Categories to Create

#### A. Symptom Assessment (40-50 examples)
- Headache, fever, cough, stomach pain, etc.
- Both Kinyarwanda and English versions
- Include when to seek emergency care

#### B. Hospital/Facility Information (50-60 examples)
- "Where is the nearest hospital in [District]?"
- "What are the operating hours of [Hospital]?"
- Emergency services information

#### C. Health Insurance (20-30 examples)
- Mutuelle de Sant√© procedures
- How to access care
- Payment categories

#### D. Disease-Specific Information (40-50 examples)
- Malaria prevention and treatment
- HIV/AIDS services
- TB treatment
- COVID-19 information
- Common childhood illnesses

#### E. Preventive Health (30-40 examples)
- Nutrition advice
- Vaccination schedules
- Hygiene practices
- Family planning

#### F. Mixed Language Conversations (20-30 examples)

## üöÄ Fine-Tuning Process (OpenAI)

### Prerequisites
- OpenAI API account with payment method
- Minimum 50 examples (recommended 200-500)
- Cost estimate: $8-$100 depending on model and data size

### Step 1: Validate Your Data

```bash
# Install OpenAI CLI
pip install openai

# Validate training file
openai tools fine_tunes.prepare_data -f training_data.jsonl
```

### Step 2: Upload Training Data

```bash
# Upload your training file
openai api files.create -f training_data.jsonl -p fine-tune
```

### Step 3: Create Fine-Tuning Job

```bash
# For GPT-3.5-turbo (recommended to start)
openai api fine_tuning.jobs.create -t file-abc123 -m gpt-3.5-turbo

# For GPT-4 (more expensive, better results)
openai api fine_tuning.jobs.create -t file-abc123 -m gpt-4o-mini
```

### Step 4: Monitor Training

```bash
# Check status
openai api fine_tuning.jobs.retrieve -i ftjob-abc123

# List all fine-tuning jobs
openai api fine_tuning.jobs.list
```

### Step 5: Use Your Fine-Tuned Model

Update `openai_integration.R`:
```r
model = "ft:gpt-3.5-turbo:your-org:bahoai:abc123"  # Your fine-tuned model ID
```

## üö® Important Considerations

### Medical Accuracy:
- **Consult with Rwandan healthcare professionals** to verify all medical information
- Include disclaimers that AI should not replace professional medical advice
- Ensure emergency information (like 912) is always accurate

### Cultural Sensitivity:
- Respect traditional medicine practices
- Be aware of health taboos and stigmas
- Use appropriate language for sensitive topics

### Legal & Ethical:
- Comply with Rwanda's data protection laws
- Don't provide diagnoses, only general health information
- Always recommend seeing a healthcare provider for serious conditions

## ü§ù Next Steps

1. **Start Small**: Begin with 50-100 high-quality examples
2. **Test Frequently**: Validate model responses with native Kinyarwanda speakers
3. **Iterate**: Fine-tuning is an ongoing process
4. **Get Feedback**: Work with healthcare workers to improve responses
5. **Scale Up**: Gradually increase training data as you see improvements
