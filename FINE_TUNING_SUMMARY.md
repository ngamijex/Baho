---

## üö® Risk Mitigation

### Medical Liability
**Risk**: Providing incorrect medical advice
**Mitigation**:
- Always include disclaimer
- Never provide diagnoses
- Always recommend seeing a doctor for serious symptoms
- Have healthcare professional review examples

### Language Quality
**Risk**: Poor Kinyarwanda causing confusion
**Mitigation**:
- Work with native speakers
- Test extensively before deployment
- Collect user feedback continuously
- Update regularly

### Data Privacy
**Risk**: Training data contains sensitive information
**Mitigation**:
- Use generic examples, not real patient data
- No personal information in training data
- Add to .gitignore (already done)
- OpenAI doesn't use fine-tuning data to train other models

### Cost Overrun
**Risk**: Unexpected high costs
**Mitigation**:
- Start small (100 examples)
- Monitor usage with OpenAI dashboard
- Set billing alerts
- Use GPT-3.5-turbo first (cheaper)

---

## üë• Team Recommendations

Ideally, assemble a small team:

### Essential Roles:
1. **Project Lead** (You!)
   - Coordinate everything
   - Make final decisions

2. **Kinyarwanda Language Expert** (1-2 people)
   - Review all Kinyarwanda responses
   - Ensure natural, proper language

3. **Healthcare Professional** (1 person)
   - Verify medical accuracy
   - Ensure safety

### Nice to Have:
4. **Data Entry Assistant**
   - Help create examples
   - Format data

5. **Tester**
   - Test the fine-tuned model
   - Provide feedback

**Can't find a team?** Start solo and:
- Post in Rwanda tech communities
- Contact local health centers
- Reach out to University of Rwanda
- Use freelance platforms (Upwork, Fiverr) for language review
